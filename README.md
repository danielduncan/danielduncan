<h1>👋 Hi, I’m @danielduncan</h1>
<ul>
  <li>👀 I’m interested in topics at the intersection of science and technology (colloquially deep tech) - in particular quantum computing. I'm also interested in cryptography (homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs) and machine learning (hardware, quantum kernels).</li>
  <li>🌱 I’m currently completing bachelor's degrees in advanced physics and computer science.</li>
  <li>💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quantum computing projects (algorithms, hardware, or in-between).</li>
  <li>📫 You can contact me at danieljzduncan@gmail.com.</li>
