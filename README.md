- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielduncan.
- 👀 I’m interested in topics at the intersection of science and technology (colloquially deep tech) - in particular quantum computing. I'm also interested in cryptography (homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs) and machine learning (hardware, quantum kernels).
- 🌱 I’m currently completing bachelor's degrees in advanced physics and computer science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quantum computing projects (algorithms, hardware, or in-between).
- 📫 You can contact me at danieljzduncan@gmail.com.
